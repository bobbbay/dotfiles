#+title: Dotfiles

[[https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg]]

/Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad./ - Cory House

This repository houses the codebase for my dotfiles. Nix all the things!

** Features

 * Nix/NixOS. Keep it declarative and reproducible.
 * Agenix. Keep secrets well-kept.
 * Home-manager. A separate, fully configurable home configuration.
 * Org-babel. Literate configuration for any application, written in Org-mode and exported with Org-babel.
 * Doom Emacs. (To the dark side!)
 * WSL NixOS. For an optimal development environment on Windows.
 * ... and more!

** In detail...

This repository is a huge [[https://github.com/divnix/digga][digga]] flake that provides outputs for all of my hosts, users, etc.

*** Secret management

In order to manage secrets, I use ryantm's [[https://github.com/ryantm/agenix][agenix]]. It conveniently encrypts everything - even in the Nix store - until my user signs in and has been recognized. I have previously used [[https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt][git-crypt]], but unfortunately, all secrets are decrypted /in the nix store/, which is dangerous - especially when share stores to, say, Cachix. This supported my migration to agenix.

*** Org tangling

Any non-Nix configuration is actually written in Org-mode. This adds the convenience of writing *any* configuration literately, and being able to export them during compiletime. More can be found on this topic [[file:home/config/default.nix][here]].
