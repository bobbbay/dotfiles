## Dotfiles

This is my NixOS configuration for my desktop as well as my laptop<sup>1</sup>.

### TODO

 - [ ] Set up cachix and create builds upon push to GitHub
 - [ ] Set up ssh keys to be declarative (try: SOPS?)
 - [ ] Read through [terlar's configs](https://github.com/terlar/nix-config) and take inspiration ~~basically steal~~ from his `nix` command bindings.
 - [ ] Add the `xplr` package
 - [ ] Find a "better" tui Git ui

1. Laptop is on NixOS WSL.
